Step 3: After the downloading has finished, open the file from downloads and run it. It will prompt the following dialog box. 
Step 4: It will start the installation, and once it is completed, it will be like the image shown below
Step 5: Once “Finish” is clicked, it will ask whether the previous settings need to be imported [if the android studio had been installed earlier], or not. It is better to choose the ‘Don’t import Settings option’.
